# Lab-7-Calculating-Matrix-Determinants
Matrices Python syntax application as a Computer Science seventh lab assignment. The multiplication of matrices were used.

This lab project was simple but important, as matrices was a difficult notion for me to wrap my head around. It is difficult to consider the first object as a "0" instead of a "1". After trial and error, the rebranding became easier to implement.
